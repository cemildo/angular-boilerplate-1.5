  "readme": "Angular Bootstrap Decorator\n==========================\n\nFor https://github.com/Textalk/angular-schema-form\n\nThis is the new Bootstrap Decorator! That means a Bootstrap 3 frontend for the Angular Schema Form\nproject. The former Bootstrap decorator used to be included in the main repo, but has now moved\nhere.\n\nThe big difference is that it now uses the new builder in, for more info on the builder see\n[our blog](https://medium.com/@SchemaFormIO/the-new-builder-pt-1-61fadde3c678).\n\nThe biggest change for users is that the form no longer contains any `<bootstrap-decorator>` tags\nsince they are no longer needed.\n\nInstall\n-------\n```sh\nbower install angular-schema-form-bootstrap\n```\nor\n\n```sh\nnpm install angular-schema-form-bootstrap\n```\n\nAnd then include `bootstrap-decorator.min.js`. Note that angular-schema-form >= 0.8.7 is needed.\n\n\nFuture\n------\nUsing the new builder opens up for a lot of optimization. Primarily we can get rid of a lot of small\nwatches by using build helpers. For instance, slapping on a `sf-changed` directive *only* if the\nform definition has an `onChange` option.\n",
